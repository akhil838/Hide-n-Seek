The face of a black cat with yellow eyes is partially visible as it peeks around the brown edge of the diagonal bisection.

## **Description**

Hide n' Seek is a browser extension that allows its users to hide job listings by companies they are not interested in as they search job boards.

This functionality is necessary because job boards do not allow job seekers to filter out jobs by company name. This results in a poor user experience, especially when many job search results are by companies that the job seeker is not interested in.

Hide n' Seek aims to solve this problem by adding "hide" buttons to all job listings within a list of job search results, allowing users to easily hide jobs with just a click.

After a job's "hide" button is clicked, Hide n' Seek will hide that job, as well as all other jobs by that company, behind an overlay, which allows the user to focus on the listings they are interested in and ignore the ones they are not. Hide n' Seek will continue to hide jobs by that company in future job search results unless the user decides to unhide the job.

Hide n' Seek also allows users to hide sponsored and promoted jobs.
